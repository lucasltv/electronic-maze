For didactic purpose (robotics or basic electronic education for KIDS), this project is a simple and small game of Electronic Labyrinth. The player must follow the course of the tortuous wire through a probe with a ring, without touching the wire. 

## Gaming
If the player touches the wire as little as possible, the circuit beeps intermittently through a buzzer inserted in the circuit and simultaneously a red LED will blink.

## Electronics
The basis of this project is a high gain transistorized amplifier called Darlington configuration, whose output is connected to an LED. As soon as a ring is touched, the capacitor is automatically charged. Once the touch is undone, the capacitor discharges slowly with the LED on.
 
A Reset button has been inserted, which aims to turn off the LED's and the buzzer, thus returning the system to the initial state.
 
The power supply can be a 9 volts battery or a power supply. In this case a 5Vdc (350mA) power supply was used.
