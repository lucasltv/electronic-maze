# electronic-maze
For didactic purpose (robotics or basic electronic education for KIDS), this project is a simple and small game of Electronic Labyrinth. The player must follow the course of the tortuous wire through a probe with a ring, without touching the wire. 

## Gaming
If the player touches the wire as little as possible, the circuit beeps intermittently through a buzzer inserted in the circuit and simultaneously a red LED will blink.
